Chuck Norris' penis has abs.
While bass fishing near a hiway bridge in his boat, Chuck Norris observed a funeral procession drive by. Out of respect, he stood-up, removed his hat placing it over his heart and thought to himself, "this is the least I can do...after all I was married to her for over 40 years".
Once when Chuck Norris was denied a Bacon McDouble at McDonald's because it was 9:35, he roundhouse kicked the store so hard that it became a KFC.
